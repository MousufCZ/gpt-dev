# GPT Transformer Language Model

Welcome to the GPT Transformer Language Model repository! This project implements a language model inspired by the Transformer architecture, aiming to generate coherent and contextually relevant text sequences using PyTorch.

## Overview

This repository encompasses the development of a GPT-style language model, focusing on the following key aspects:

- **Model Architecture:** Implementation of a language model architecture based on the Transformer framework, incorporating token embeddings, positional encodings, multi-head self-attention mechanisms, and feedforward layers.

- **Training and Optimization:** Efficient training loops utilizing PyTorch's capabilities and optimizing the model's learning process using the AdamW optimiser.

- **Hyperparameter Exploration:** Experimentation with hyperparameters such as embedding sizes, attention head counts, and learning rates to enhance the model's performance.

- **Text Generation:** Application of the trained model to generate fluent and coherent text sequences based on provided seed text.

## Key Features

- **Transformer-Based Model:** PyTorch-based implementation of a GPT-style language model inspired by the Transformer architecture.

- **Training Loop:** Efficient training procedures leveraging PyTorch's capabilities for neural network training and optimisation.

- **Hyperparameter Tuning:** Exploration and fine-tuning of hyperparameters to enhance the model's performance in text generation tasks.

- **Text Generation Functionality:** Demonstration of the model's ability to generate contextually relevant text based on learned patterns.
